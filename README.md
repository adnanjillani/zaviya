The Zaviya project is a modern, interactive, and user-friendly restaurant management and booking website designed to enhance customer experience. It serves as a digital platform for Zaviya, a classy restaurant offering Italian, Pakistani, and Chinese cuisines. The website allows users to easily explore menu items, make table reservations, and place orders online in advance. It features three distinct sections: a casual space for long stays with snacks, a family-only area with play facilities for kids, and an executive-class area offering premium services for elite customers. The project is developed using React for a responsive and dynamic user interface, Node.js for server-side operations, and MongoDB for database management. The platform also integrates APIs to manage menus, reservations, and online orders efficiently, ensuring seamless interaction between customers and restaurant services. Overall, the Zaviya project aims to combine functionality, elegance, and convenience to provide an exceptional dining experience in the digital era.
